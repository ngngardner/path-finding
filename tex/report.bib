  abstract = {A dynamic path planning method based on a gated recurrent unit-recurrent neural network model is proposed for the problem of path planning of a mobile robot in an unknown space. A deep neural network with sensor input is used to generate a new control strategy output to the physical model to control the movement of the robot and thus achieve collision avoidance behavior. Inputs and tags are derived from sample sets generated by an improved artificial potential field and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm. In order to make the ant colony algorithm converge quickly, the pheromone trail and the state transition probability are improved. The field function of the artificial potential field method is modified. Using the end-to-end network model to learn the mapping between input and output in the sample data, the direction and speed of the mobile robot are obtained. The simulation experiments and realistic simulations show that the network model can plan a reasonable path in an unknown environment. Compared with other traditional path planning algorithms, the proposed method is more robust than the traditional path planning algorithms to differences in the robot structure.},

  abstract  = {Every autonomous vehicle or any other application which requires reaching a destination, path planning is an important task. Once a destination is determined there can be various ways to reach there, but optimum use of resources to reach there is important. Hence path planning is an important part of navigation. There have been many developments over the years to realize the best path using different techniques. Recent developments on Neural Networks made it an important research topic for path planning. Many classifiers, learning algorithms have been tested and experimented for path planning. Deep Neural Networks have recently developed and seems to given better results compared to other machine learning techniques and there is larger space for research as well. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) under the deep neural networks are observed and regarded to be usually applicable for path planning. But in this study Recurrent Neural Network technique (RNN) is being proposed. This is because RNN uses past inputs for present output which makes it applicable for temporal data. Hence in dynamic obstacle avoidance environment this method can help to predict path quicker than CNN. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) is the algorithm that is mainly focused in this paper. LSTM is an extended version of RNN and this makes it suitable for congested environment. In this paper LSTM is applied for path planning in environment with obstacles and compared with the results of highly popular A* algorithm.},
