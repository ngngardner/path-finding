# Research Project - Custom Path-Finding Agent

## Custom Research Environment

1. Environment size (>16x16)
2. Fixed generation
3. Random generation
   a. Obstacles (blobs)
   b. Traps (slows down agent)
4. Fixed and Random (compare)
   a. Starting location
   b. Goal location
5. Way to ensure that a path exists
6. Orthogonal movement

### Stretch

1. Obstacles of random sizes

## Goals

1. Create custom environment
2. Define agent behavior
3. Wrap in Gym.env API
4. Train model
